# React Boilerplate

## Intro
I have been learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) lately, and I have used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to create my React projects easily with minimal efforts and configuration, and I guess you too have most probably used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) to create your react apps.These are fantastic tools if you want to just focus on React and let them take care of the configuration. But is this the way you want to learn React? Probably not, thatâ€™s why I decided to build my own boilerplate for easy React project kickstarting. 

## Getting started
Before starting, you must have npm installed on your computer, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Clone the repo


    git clone https://github.com/pavvo/react-boilerplate

#### Run this commands

    npm install
    npm start

## Enjoy!
